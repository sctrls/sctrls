#### Today I start focusing on the python I enjoy. On day 100 I'll be new.

<br>

Cursory goals for these 100 days:
- Incorporate the farm and have a workable sensor setup
- Have passed at least one technical interview for python development
- Have a working notes and toolbox repository
- Have given at least one recap, and possibly any number of lectures at lewagon
- Practice C and have a little C++ under my belt (lovely to have)
- Define these goals in actionable and time-bound terms

1  | One hour is current maximum productive coding time. Make atomic commits.<br />1. Figure out black configuration <br />2. Add testing and solidify the praxis. It would have saved time. <br />3. Better comments. Have an outline handy. <br />4. Define max time for appliations and for coding. <br /> 5. Handle pending linkedin message.
