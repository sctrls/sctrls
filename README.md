# Hello! I'm Ale.

### Welcome to my garden.

I'll be nursing my projects to germination day by day and keeping track of
it all here. Welcome!

### 21/06/2022
#### Today I start focusing on the python I enjoy. On day 100 I'll be new.

<br/>

Cursory goals for these 100 days (with allowances for family time):
- Every day, either add to something interesting or useful, or learn something by building it for 1+ hours.
- Incorporate the farm and have a workable sensor setup (https://sctrls.github.io/farm.html could use love!)
- Have passed at least one technical interview for python development
- Have a working notes and toolbox repository
- Have given at least one recap, and possibly any number of lectures at lewagon
- Practice C and have a little C++ under my belt (lovely to have)
- Define these goals in actionable and time-bound terms

<br/>
Project Ideas

Project | Desc and Stack
------- | ----
personal website | Host and serve it properly, making space for personal apis in the future (Flask). Data display.
myconet | Modular sensor data upload from Pi Zeros to my web api.
otw tracker widget | Get and display my progress on overthewire (and wakatime).

Day | Comment
--- | -------
1  | One hour is current maximum productive coding time. Make atomic commits. Reworking my coding timer at pie_break, at the moment. <br/>1. Figure out black configuration <br/>2. Add testing and solidify the praxis. It would have saved time. <br/>3. Better comments. Have an outline handy. <br/>4. Define max time for appliations and for coding. <br/>5. Handle pending linkedin message.
2 | pie_break is packaged and working as an installable script.<br/>1. Had a heavy day today. In future, focus on one limited thing on such days.
3 | Looked at threading and asyncio today. Skipped two days. Make allowances for family time, or ruin that time in the future.<br/>1. Asyncio is very interesting: I need to look at it more closely in the future. The multi-threading works at the moment.<br/>2. pie_break is fun but a mess. Reminds me of my thesis project: could have taken a third of the time if I had started with requirements, diagrams, and tests. But this isn't exactly that sort of thing. It's a playground, and adding iteratively is low pressure. These are tough days, so one day at a time gets it done.<br/>3. TODO: testing, a single comment framework!, cli for dynamic settings.
